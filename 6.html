<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The majority of, if not all future fatalities due to counterfeit drugs can be avoided with regulated distribution clinics. In Portugal, instead of throwing people into prison and fining them hundreds of thousands of dollars like the U.S, drug abusers are considered &lsquo;sick&rsquo;, and are even given free sterile needles to avoid HIV or Hepatitis infections at specialized clinics if they so need them. The point is, not all drugs should be legal, but the government and society shouldn&rsquo;t shun those who choose to use, or helplessly abuse said substance, but instead help and make an effort to rehabilitate the sick.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe; 1% of the population was addicted to heroin, which was worse than Baltimore at the time. And every year the government tried &lsquo;the American way,&rsquo; they cracked down on the addicts and distributors, they made punishments worse, and they would literally chase down as many drug using citizens as they could, and every year the problem got worse. So one day, the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers got together and they decided, &ldquo;look, let&rsquo;s set up a council of doctors and scientists to figure out how to solve the problem. And let&rsquo;s agree in advance that we will abide by whatever the deem the best solution.&rdquo;(paraphrased). The Scientists and doctors came back and they said, Decriminalize everything, from cannabinoids to cocaine to heroin. But, take all of the money used on hunting down, imprisoning, and trying addicts in court and direct it to the funding of the best treatment programs in the world.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">So, effective July 1, 2001, Portugal has become the first European country to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of all drugs, the goal of this strategy was to minimize long term drug use by creating an environment in which drug abusers can more easily identify their problem and be more open to the idea of treatment. The argument was that a fear in prosecution and prison sentencing drives users into hiding as well as that treatment is a much cheaper alternative to incarceration. In 1999, there were 80 deaths from opioid induced overdoses in Portugal, in 2012 that number was 16. For reference, according to the CDC: </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7">&ldquo;During 2015, a total of 52,404 persons in the United States died from a drug overdose, an increase from 47,055 in 2014; among these deaths, 33,091 (63.1%) involved an opioid, an increase from 28,647 in 2014. The age-adjusted opioid-involved death rate increased by 15.6%, from 9.0 per 100,000 in 2014 to 10.4 in 2015, driven largely by increases in deaths involving heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;The report later goes on to state that the drug overdose rate &ldquo;increased significantly&rdquo; from 123 overdoses per million residents in 2010 to 163 overdoses per million residents in 2015 (Rudd, Seth, David, Scholl 2016). In Portugal, almost 90% of the funding for drug policy has been redirected towards treatment, while the remaining 10% is focused on preventing the drug traffickers and synthesizers, and it works. Portugal&rsquo;s current death rate for all drugs is five times lower than the E.U. average of 17.3 deaths per million citizens at 3 deaths per million residents. (EMCDDA 2015).</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">In a report studying the effects of decriminalization published by the Cato Institute, it was found that within 3 years of decriminalization, there was a significant drop in usage by teenagers as well as HIV infections from shared needles, the number of patients in treatment programs increased by 147%, rising from 6,040 in 1999 to 14,877 in 2003. According to Figure 4, close to no (exclusive) drug users have been sentenced to jail time since 2002, while showing a noticeable decrease in drug dealer sentencing. The author noted that although drug use has not been eliminated, and that the policy was far from perfect, decriminalization did not lead to an increase in overall drug use. The study found that in the age groups of 13-18, drug usage rates went down in virtually in every substance since decriminalization [Figure 5]. The only increase being that of a slight rise in the use of psychoactive substances in the 15-24 age group (Greenwald 2009), which will later be proven to not only have little to no harm, but also to be beneficial if taken in the right circumstances. &ldquo;And in virtually every category of any significance,&rdquo; the author said, &ldquo;Portugal, since decriminalization, has outperformed the vast majority of other states that continue to adhere to a criminalization regime&rdquo; (Greenwald 2009), a claim which has been backed up and supported by all of the scientific data collected.</span></p>
