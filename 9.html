<p class="c9"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">There was an experiment done on medical rats in which they were placed in cages with normal water and heroin infused water. Every time this experiment was run, the rat became obsessed with the dug water and kept coming back for larger and larger amounts until it killed itself. In the 1970s, professor of psychology Bruce Alexander of the University of British Columbia noticed a fault in the experiment, the rat was left in the cage alone; &ldquo;Rats in nature are highly social, sexual, and industrious creatures. Putting such a creature in solitary confinement would be the equivalent of doing the same thing to a human being.&rdquo; he said in an article on his website describing the experiment (</span><span class="c1">Alexander</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;2010). </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, professor Bruce Alexander built a &lsquo;Rat Park&rsquo;, a paradise like cage in which the rat&rsquo;s every need was fulfilled. Tunnels to scamper around, a hamster wheel, the finest rat food, and most importantly, other rats to spend their time with. The results contradicted the previous &lsquo;modern&rsquo; understanding of addiction in every way, the rats in rat park did not like the drug water, most avoiding it after their first time trying it. The average rat consumed less than a quarter of what an isolated rat would consume in isolation, none of them did so compulsively and none of them died.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #FFFFFF; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 432.00px; height: 289.00px;"><img alt="" src="/wod/wodimg/rat_park.png" style="width: 432.00px; height: 289.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Aerial View&rdquo; of Rat Park, North Wing </span><span class="c2 c1">(Alexander 2010)</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Johann Hari, author of </span><span class="c1 c10">Chasing The Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on which this section is largely based, this experiment could easily just be a behavior specific to rats, coincidentally, during the same time period there was a similar example going on in the world known as the Vietnam War. </span><span class="c1">A </span><span class="c1">study on the usage of narcotics in U.S. soldiers both before and after the Vietnam war found that almost half (45%) of the soldiers enlisted have tried narcotics, that 34% have tried heroin, and 38% have tried opium. Addiction there was very common, approximately 20% of the soldiers reported feeling addicted to a narcotic while in Vietnam (Robins 1993). For comparison, as reported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Vermont has the highest percentage usage of drugs with </span><span class="c1">15.29%</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;of adults reporting to have tried a narcotic in the past month (SAMHSA 2012-13). Upon finding out about the amount of people who have or are using illicit drugs in Vietnam, many were understandably terrified, believing massive numbers of addicts would pour into the streets of the country once the war was over. But in the study, Robins found that 95% of those who were addicted in Vietnam had simply quit upon their return home. After 3 years, only 12% of those who have been addicted in Vietnam suffered a drug addiction at any point, the majority of which have been very brief. And it is not the treatment that explains the remarkable rate of recovery, less than 2% of those who used narcotics in Vietnam received treatment after return. Note that there was a &ldquo;simple detoxification&rdquo; administered to less than a third of soldiers who used narcotics regularly when leaving Vietnam (Robins 1993). If a person is placed into a ghastly jungle in a foreign country where you don&rsquo;t want to be, with the possibility to die or have to kill at any moment, doing heroin is not an abnormal option on the list of ways to spend time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the publishing of the Rat Park study, Professor Alexander ran a further experiment in which he left the rats alone and allowed them to become compulsive users of the heroin water. After leaving the rats in the cages for 57 days, he took them out of isolation and placed them into rat park; this was done to study the effects on addiction after being reintegrated into society. The rats had few symptoms of withdrawal, few relapses, stopping their heavy use within the first few days with many stopping entirely within the first 14 days. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c2"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c1">Being taken out of Vietnam and sent home is the equivalent of being taken out of the cage and being placed into rat park; it&rsquo;s not the chemicals that determine how much you suffer, it&rsquo;s your cage. The human being has an intrinsic need to bond and connect, it is how humanity gets it satisfaction and fulfillment. If humans can&rsquo;t connect with one another, they connects with whatever is closest or they can find. Hari says in his book, &ldquo;the core of addiction doesn&rsquo;t lie in what you swallow or inject, it&rsquo;s in the pain you feel in your head&rdquo; (</span><span class="c1">Hari</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;2015, p166). Professor Peter Cohen believes that society must stop the discussion about &lsquo;addiction&rsquo; entirely, and substitute it with the word &lsquo;bonding&rsquo;. A drug addict bonded with his or her drug of choice because they lacked the ability to fully bond with anyone else. The opposite of addiction isn&rsquo;t sobriety, it&rsquo;s human connection (</span><span class="c1">Cohen</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;1990). When humans are healthy and happy, they bond with the people around them, when they are not, whether they are traumatized, isolated, or simply beaten down by life, they bond with what gives them relief. These bonds could be drugs, reddit, video games, gambling, or the most common today which is that of constantly being on or with a smartphone. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c2 c1">The implications the previous theory of addiction has on the War on Drugs is that instead of helping drug addicts, they are excluded from society, have their benefits taken from them, lose their ability to easily get jobs or become stable, and are thrown into prison which is a literal cage. What the government is doing is placing people who are mentally ill into a situation that makes them worse, and loathe them when they don&rsquo;t recover.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p>
