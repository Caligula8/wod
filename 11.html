<p class="c4"><span class="c12">One important aspect that most do not understand is how and why alcohol and sugar cause the diseases they do. Table sugar, is made up of equal parts Glucose and Fructose; Fructose is in honey, it&rsquo;s in fruit juice it&rsquo;s in high fructose corn syrup, it what gives food it&rsquo;s sweet taste. In his lecture </span><span class="c12 c14">Sugar: The Bitter Truth</span><span class="c1">, Dr. Robert Lustig, arguably the most influential figure in the fight against sugar said &ldquo;You wouldn&#39;t think twice about not giving your kid a Budweiser, but you don&rsquo;t think twice about giving your kid a can of coke. But they&rsquo;re the same.&rdquo; At first he may seem a bit over the top on his claims and statements on sugar, but unlike the companies that rely on sugar for their customer base Dr. Lustig&rsquo;s statements are backed up by over 16 years worth of research. If there is one quote that can summarize his belief, &ldquo;Sugar is a poison. It is a chronic, dose dependent, hepatic (liver) toxin&rdquo; is it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many side effects you throw at another person, they will get the point at about the second effect and block out the rest, but explaining and understanding the biochemistry as described by Dr. Lustig paints a much more vivid picture. To understand how a nontoxic compound is processed in the body let&rsquo;s look at the metabolization of Glucose. Note that it is not important to memorize or know any of the terms below, what is important is to pay attention to how Glucose flows in the body.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c2">Figure 7:</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #ffffff; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 510.50px; height: 339.21px;"><img alt="" src="/wod/wodimg/f7.png" style="width: 510.50px; height: 339.21px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">(The Trouble With Fructose: A Darwin Perspective Presentation Slides, Lustig 2011)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">So let&rsquo;s say for example one were to eat a high Glucose containing food item, only about 20% of the glucose would reach the liver because the rest is metabolized by the rest of the cells in the body. To get into the liver Glucose must first stimulate the pancreas to make Insulin, the Insulin stimulates the IRS-1 receptor which then sets off a series of reactions resulting in the activation of Glucokinase. Glucokinase takes the Glucose to the Glucose-6-Phosphate(P) which is stored in the liver as Glycogen, Glycogen is almost like the reserve tank of energy that the body access&rsquo;s when necessary. What doesn&#39;t go to glycogen get metabolized into Pyruvate, which goes to the mitochondria to be burned into energy (ATP). The SREBP1 activates the ACL, ACC, and FAS enzymes to start the Denovolipogenisis ( Denovo new, lipo fat, genis making). The fat is then converted to VLDL, and stored as fat tissue. This fat is not terrible because only 20% of the Glucose entered the liver, half of that was made into glycogen, and a majority of the rest was burned off elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c10 c2"><strong>Figure 8:</strong></span></p>

<p class="c3 c11"><span class="c1">(The Trouble With Fructose: A Darwin Perspective Presentation Slides, Lustig 2011)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Because Fructose is not necessary for survival, it is treated as a foreign substance and nearly all of it is metabolized in the liver, almost all of which enters the mitochondria. None of the Fructose gets stored into Glycogen and overloads the livers mitochondria cells. After going through the TCA cycle, an abundance of Citrate is produced which then gets converted to VLDL, which poses an increased risk of visceral fat accumulation and heart disease. Much like in Glucose, fat leaves the cell as free fatty acids, but in such a large amount that it creates insulin resistance in the muscles. Not all of the fat can get out so now there is fat that accumulates in the liver which is labeled Lipid Droplet, this is known as non alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fructose also forms Xylulose-5-Phosphate which further stimulates the Denovolipogenisis enzymes which creates more fat. When fructose is being converted to Fructose-1-Phosphate, it produces Uric acid which raises blood pressure, this explains the prevalence of Hypertension with excessive sugar eating.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span class="c1">Like Fructose, Ethanol is not necessary for any biological function of process, so the majority of it is processed as a toxin in the liver. The difference between Glucose and Ethanol is that the liver has to use 4 times more effort to process Ethanol than Glucose because it has to process 80% of the total alcohol consumed. After diffusing into the liver and being converted to Acetaldehyde, Ethanol produces ROS or Reactive Oxygen Species. ROS damage proteins in the body, can cause cancer, and are thought to be the leading contributing factor to aging. After going through The TCA cycle, its is converted to citrate which is eventually converted to VLDL. Simultaneously, the same 3 enzymes responsible for fat creation are stimulated to create even more VLDL. Some of the fat is exported out in the form of free fatty acids, these can get into muscles causing very problematic muscle insulin resistance. Some of the Fat cannot get out of the liver, so a Lipid Droplet just sitting in the liver, and there is the Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. The excess of Acyl-Coa, the ROS, and the Ethanol stimulate an enzyme called JNK1, much like in Fructose. JNK1 causes inflammation, which results in further damage to the liver and promotes insulin resistance in the liver by deactivating IRS-1, the insulin receptor from the Glucose model</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c10 c2">Figure 10:</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c12">Although sugar addiction has been proven and established in rats, establishing addiction in humans is very different. According to the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1497828302196000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwfkKQM-Z7bCuXELO8kQOygSqPig">APA </a></span><span class="c1">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, three of the following seven criteria need to be met; of the psychological are bingeing on the substance, the presence of a desire to quit, having the substance interfering with daily life, craving or seeking the substance, and irrational use despite negative consequences. Of the physiological criteria, is tolerance and withdrawal. Tolerance is the most objectively accurate and easiest criteria to establish because neuroimaging can used to observe the effects of the substance. What happens in the case of tolerance is the dopamine receptors become downregulated and are less responsive to the same amounts of a substance. As can be observed in figure 10, the brain of both a cocaine addict and a frequent sugar consumer both have very visibly downregulated the dopamine receptors. People who report attempting to quit sugar consistently report symptoms such as mood swings, headaches, anxiety, general fatigue, muscle aches, and physical tremors, this is withdrawal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7 c18"><span class="c9"></span></p>
