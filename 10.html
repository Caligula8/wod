<p class="c5"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Going back to the claim, &ldquo;Every drug user gives up their ability to act and think rationally and his potential for a full productive life&rdquo; by the ONDCP, it is truly amusing, and almost humorous as to how mistaken they are in this statement. Firstly, as has been established, caffeine is the world&rsquo;s most dangerous drug, but there is another drug, that which is even more widespread and accepted in society with effects ranging from obesity to diabetes. A drug that could consistently make a crying baby happy, and as a matter of fact, more often than not parents do give it to their babies and children. Adults and children alike consume it in unhealthy and often dangerous amounts on a daily basis. This drug: Sugar. Saying sugar is a drug is a bit like saying M&amp;Ms are a candy/chocolate bar, it&rsquo;s not wrong but it is looked down upon by most. In a study published to the national library of medicine, evidence showed &ldquo;that sugar and sweetness can induce reward and craving that are comparable in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs&rdquo;(Ahmed, Guillem, Vandaele 2013). Sugar has been known to have effects on the opioid and dopamine receptors in the brain, relearning dopamine or the &lsquo;feel good&rsquo; chemical through the brain, tampering with the natural reward system in the long term.</span></p><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It is known all too well how alcohol can destroy a liver, it is almost unheard of for a person to disagree that alcohol is a toxin and is intoxicating; and to most people, knowing the effects is usually not even close to make them consider quitting. These immediate effects being: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Slurred speech, drowsiness, irregular heartbeat, dilated blood vessels, headaches, breathing difficulties, distorted vision and hearing, impaired judgment, decreased perception and coordination, cns depression, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, unconsciousness, anemia, blackouts, and possible death.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">For many, it&rsquo;s as though no matter how many effects you provide, even if you start making them up, they still have just as little incentive to quit as before they knew.The same can be said for sugar, it&rsquo;s only short term effect is the release of Dopamine, which was most likely the reason for its manifestation into mainstream western culture, but it has just as many long term effects which are just as bad. For reference, the long term effects of excessive ethanol or common drinking alcohol consumption include but are not limited to:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Alcohol poisoning, high blood pressure, stroke, and other heart-related diseases, liver diseases such as alcoholic fatty liver disease, nerve damage, sexual problems, pancreatitis, cardiac dilation, permanent damage to the brain, amnesia, blood disorders, apathy and disorientation, malnutrition, electrolyte abnormalities, gastritis (inflammation of stomach walls), and cancers of the mouth and throat, only to name a few. (World Health Organization 2014)</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The long term effects directly related to excessive sugar consumption include but are not limited to: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney diseases, non-alcoholic liver disease, tooth decay and cavities, types of arthritis and Hypertension (high blood pressure ) .</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The indirect long term effects of excess sugar consumption by result of obesity include but are not limited to:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">High LDL (bad) cholesterol, low HDL (good) cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides (Dyslipidemia), coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and breathing problems, some cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, and liver), low quality of life, mental illness such as clinical depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders, body pain and difficulty with physical functioning, and of course death. </span><span class="c0">(National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 1998)</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A 2007 study presented rats with the ability to chose between a sugar water solution and a cocaine water solution 8 times a day. A majority of rats, 94% prefered and almost always went back to the sugar water solution. It has even been observed that when being exposed to sugar, rodents, even when already addicted to cocaine, quickly cease their need for cocaine and will work much harder to get sugar, even when it means walking over a electric panel that shocks them (Lenoir 2007). But what implication does this have on humans? There are several recreation substances that exist in nature without the need for much processing to be effective, dried tobacco leaves, beer from barley, or even the sap from the opium poppy plant to name a few. The closer a many substances are to their natural state, the less problematic they are, while smoking tobacco in any form is harmful, it takes continuous and repetitive use over months or even years for it to make any noticeable effect. </span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These substances only become terribly addictive and more harmful once you extensively refine them. It can even be argued that opium use was never a world problem until it was conceived of as a problem by British Colonial policy makers. In 1810, morphine was derived from opium, and became available from the mid 1850s onward to be used as a painkiller by doctors. Due to the injuries in and harsh conditions of the Civil War most of the soldiers were exposed to morphine, there were suddenly tens of thousands of addicted soldiers. Then in 1874, heroin which is derived from morphine, was marketed as morphine&rsquo;s non addictive substitute, and since then the heroin addict has been ever present worldwide. Another example is that of the dangerous and addictive cocaine, another refined substance. Cocaine is a refinement of coca leaves, leaves that have been chewed by farmers for thousands of years in South America for energy boosting purposes without any noteworthy or detrimental health effects. Alcohol also doesn&rsquo;t become truly strong until it is refined or distilled, it is undeniable that alcoholics in almost all cases skips weaker fermented alcohols such as wine, cider, or beer, and show much more interest in harder alcohols such as Whisky, Gin, and Vodka.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In each of these examples the result of refinement is a higher concentration of a particular ingredient that has a greater effect on the brain&rsquo;s reward system. Distilled alcohol results in faster intoxication for less liquid, cocaine and heroin require hundreds of less times the amount of their unrefined counterparts to even come close to achieving the same effect. For example, 100 kilograms of coca leaves will produce around 300 to 1200 grams of cocaine. This is where sugar is no different, it is a substance that affects the brain&rsquo;s reward system and releases dopamine as well as is a result of a refining process. Sugar activates the brain&rsquo;s reward system even to an even greater degree than most other substances because humans have been programmed through evolution to seek sweet foods in particular, one of the reasons being that indigenous sweet foods are very rarely poisonous. With sugar cane, about half the weight of one stock is liquid, and of that only 20% of that liquid is actual sugar, the result of the refinement process is a substance 10 times sweeter than that of what is started with. The average American consumes about 82 grams of sugar per day, to consume this much sugar a person would have to consume over two pounds of sugar cane. This is two pounds of fiber rich plant material that isn&rsquo;t being processed with the sugar, the fiber slows the rate at which the sugar is released into the system, and the sugar is absorbed abnormally rapidly as a result.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c13">In the documentary </span><span class="c6">That Sugar Film</span><span class="c6">,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">filmmaker Damon Gameau goes on a 60 day experimental high sugar diet and documented the effects. Despite consuming the same amount of calories and only changing his sugar intake. Within the 60 days he had gained 19.5 pounds, and by the 18th day he had developed non alcoholic fatty liver disease. The real issue with sugar is that almost all Americans are over dosing and over consuming sugar on a daily basis; the food supply is becoming more and more sugar overrun, 80% of foods in the U.S. now have sugars added to them. It can be argued that the advent of high fructose corn syrup, which is chemically similar to table sugar, was the very moment that would later manifest itself into today&rsquo;s obesity epidemic. Because of the way subsidies are managed in the U.S. we end up with a massive amount of corn. In 2010, 32% of the world&rsquo;s corn supply originated in the U.S., $63.9 billion worth came from U.S. farmers (USDA 2007) this is a major contribution to the popularity of high fructose corn syrup. Sugar and high fructose corn syrup may have build up a bad reputation over time, but there are 54 other names for sugar that food corporations can use to attract health conscious &nbsp;customers and hide the presence of sugar through their products. Included are brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose, alongside 40 others. For this reason most Americans consume more than twice the recommended daily limit without even knowing it. (Implications of which are to be continued under Culture)</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p>
