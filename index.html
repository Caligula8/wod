<p>This is my essay analyzing the impact of the war on drugs, drugs and their place in society, as well as drug enforcement systems and their effectiveness. Every year I write an long essay for the reason of just really wanting to learn about that subject and putting it into words to share with the rest of the world. The way I structure my essays is such in way that if someone with no background research on the topic reads the essay then they could learn everything that is worth knowing on the subject. This essay is somewhat different because it is the first in which I have a legitimate point to argue unlike the others which are purley informative. Rest assured, thhis essay is still entirely scientifically based with the both sides of the argument addressed.</p>
