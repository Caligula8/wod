<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a surprise to many, but the scariest part of illicit drug use, regardless of the drug, is being apprehended by law enforcement. A drug user knows that their entire life would be ruined if they were to be subject to prosecution, thrown into a cage for a set period of time which they have little to no say in, and render their ability to get a job void with almost all companies and corporations. What is common for drug users not to know, is what they are receiving. One of the greatest dangers regarding drug use in today&rsquo;s society is having been told that what is being sold is one substance, when in actuality another is being received. This is all too common, illegal drug producers often find new, cheaper, and more dangerous compounds with effects similar to the original, almost never caring for the health effects, LD50, or what other harmful compounds were used in its synthesization, only caring for the profit they make. (This also happens unknowingly very often.)</span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The U.S. is currently in the age of research chemicals, although these chemicals may be safe at times, there is almost no empirical evidence of any short term or long term safety potential, or danger potential for that matter. This is due to both their relatively recent creation and government restriction. One dangerous substance has become increasingly popular in recent years, this substance is called 25i-NBOME, or any or any of the NBOME compounds of which there are many. These compounds are particularly dangerous because they are fatal in the microgram range and are almost always sold disguised as LSD due to them being a cheaper alternative. It is also important to note, as well as make known, there have been no recorded overdoses in history directly as a result of ingesting LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, or marijuana. And it is not only psychedelic substances which are sold under false names, fentanyl is a common knockoff for painkillers, opiates, as well as benzodiazepines. Fentanyl is reported to be 40-100 times stronger than morphine, which is 20-30 times more powerful than heroin, and a person who abuses this drug who is not accustomed to opiates is likely to kill themselves due purely to its strength (Narconon International 2017). </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even MDMA, also known as ecstasy when other substances are added, is infamous for the pure amount of unknown substances being sold as counterfeits, there is no single source that even comes close to listing them all. In the 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s popularity was increasing, it used to just be caffeine and other structurally similar substances such as MDA. Today only 33.4% of pills are suspected to actually contain only MDMA, with Amphetamines and Piperazines being the 2 most common non structurally similar chemicals, and even PMA at times. PMA is far more toxic and deadly at lower doses than MDMA, but takes longer to take effect, this leads users to take more when they don&rsquo;t feel the effects. High, or even just above average doses of PMA or PMMA usually lead to coma, seizures, or death. Doses as low as 60 mg can cause significant and severe increase in blood pressure, body temperature and pulse, for reference, it is not unheard of for pills sold as MDMA to have as much as 260 mg of substance in them.</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Due to the illegality and strict regulation on all schedule 1 substances, it is extremely difficult and almost never worth it in today&rsquo;s society for organizations to conduct any kind of research on the uses of these substances. As a result the only information is provided by the government without scientific basis, by the media who can and often do misinterpret the already limited amount of research there is, or by friends who nearly never have any idea as to what they&rsquo;re talking about. Nixon&rsquo;s false claims spread during his presidency on the harmfulness of drugs resulted in the widespread fear and negative connotation around these targeted substances. This fear, as represented in figure 3, resulted in what snowballed into the U.S. government&rsquo;s war against its citizens. Starting with the public and government developing a widespread fear of the substance(s), and ending in an extremely difficult to break cycle of organized crime relating to drugs growing, law enforcement using harsher tactics, criminals becoming more violent, which then leads to the frequency of violent crime increasing. </span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Student in schools should be taught the full extent and full truth to whichever subject they are being taught in, is this not true? The same should apply to that in the field of drug use and safety, instead of demonizing even the most harmless drugs based on lies spread and upheld since the 70&rsquo;s, students should be taught, all while still advising them not to take said drugs, which drugs are more harmful to others, which substances are lethal and which aren&#39;t, the full list of negative but also positive side effects, addiction and reliable ways of dealing with it, as well as the consequences of mixing controlled substances. For example, SSRIs, or common antidepressant medication, can be potentially lethal when mixed with MAOIs or Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors which are substances that hinder the body&rsquo;s ability to break down a wide range of chemicals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
