<p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1">Milton Friedman, American Economist and Nobel Prize winner in Economic Sciences of the year 1976 said in an interview, &ldquo;I see an America with half the number of prisons, half the number of prisoners, 10,000 fewer homicides a year, inner cities in which there&#39;s a chance for these poor people to live without being afraid for their lives, not being subject to becoming criminals in order to get their drug, and being able to get drugs of which they&rsquo;re sure of the quality.&rdquo;(Friedman 1991) In this interview regarding drug decriminalization, Friedman make the point clear, that he does not believe it to be moral to to impose heavy costs on other citizens, to protect people fro their own choices, he argues drug criminalization to be a moral problem rather than an economic one. Friedman has estimated, statistically, that the prohibition of drugs produces on average 10,000 additional homicides a year, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a moral problem, that the government is going around killing 10,000 people a year. It&rsquo;s a moral problem, that the government is going around making into criminals, people, who may be doing something you and I don&#39;t approve of, but are doing something that hurts nobody else.&rdquo;(Friedman 1991) He then points out that most drug arrests are that of casual users, and as seen in Figure 4, Portugal understands this flaw in the rest of the world&rsquo;s drug policies, ceasing all arrests of civilians carrying under a certain amount of any controlled substance.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1">The true issue, Friedman claims, is that the government has put itself into the position of converting harmless, innocent people into criminals, throwing them in jail and destroying their lives. The argument behind the war on drugs is &ldquo;exactly as strong and as weak as the case for prohibiting people from overeating&rdquo;(Friedman 1991). And it doesn&#39;t take 42 page research paper or argument to prove to another average person that obesity cases a considerable amount of more death than drugs. According to the CDC, 36.5% of adults in the U.S. have obesity (Ogden,Carroll, Fryar, Flegal 2015), and side effects of obesity include heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer. In the United states, on average, Heart diseases kill 614,348 people every year, Cancer kills 591,699 people every year, Stroke kills 133,103 people annually, and Diabetes kill 76,488 people annually (National Center for Health Statistics 2015). Note that not all of these deaths may be caused by obesity although a large number of them can be traced back to some factor relating to overeating. Now imagine, a society in which reaching above a certain body fat percentage resulted into being thrown into prison, only to have the rest of your life ruined, as well as being looked down on by society, being almost forced into the lowest class of any social hierarchy and being labeled the worst kind of human there is. If it is in principle, morally acceptable for a government to say &ldquo;you must not consume drugs because they&rsquo;ll do you harm,&rdquo; why is it not morally acceptable to make the claim &ldquo;you must not eat too much because you&rsquo;ll do harm&rdquo;(Friedman 1991), to strip a citizen of his freedom and his life to prevent them from harming themselves.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Full </span><span class="c1">decriminalization or legalization may not be perfect, or even a good idea for that matter, however, the policy that Portugal has implemented does have a major flaw, the use of drugs has been decriminalized, but there is no legal access to said drugs. A very interesting example is that of </span><span class="c1">Switzerland</span><span class="c1">, in 1994 the world&#39;s largest heroin legalization and (legal) distribution program was passed with an overwhelming approval of 68% by Swiss voters, simultaneously, there was a rejection for the decriminalization of cannabis. The basic principal of the program is if you are a heroin addict, you go to your doctor and if they believe you are an addict, which they almost always do, they can send you to a clinic which you can go to every morning and inject, snort, or inhale your heroin there, you can&rsquo;t take it out of the clinic and you are never given enough to overdose, the amount is decreased progressively (Killias &amp; Aebi 2000, Hari 2015). In the words of Johann Hari, author of the New York Times best-selling book </span><span class="c1 c11">Chasing The Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs, </span><span class="c6 c1">&ldquo;The results have been incredible. Burglary massively fell, street prostitution just ended, muggings and street robbery massively fell, disease transmission massively fell,&rdquo;(Hari 2015). Figure 6, of Martin Killias&rsquo;s and Marcelo F. Aebi&rsquo;s analysis shows just how impactful the prescription heroin program is, 74% of participants reported no use in the last 6 months 18 months after admission to the program.</span></p>

<p class="c7"><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c1 c11 c12">In the eye&rsquo;s of the author)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">The ideal United States or even worldwide drug policy would revolve around objective truth and research as the leading determining factor in how heavily drugs are enforced and how widely available each drug should be, it should also determine what the best treatment policies are and where funds are spent, much like the way Portugal approached their drug problem. The ideal policy also takes the concept of the Swiss four pillar system; prevention, therapy, harm reduction, and law enforcement. Each pillar is to be taken equally as seriously, to be balanced, and to have it&rsquo;s aim clear. Every policy passes must have its best interest to be the quality and betterment of human life, without infringing upon it. If a policy does not work, fails, or a better alternative is found, the government cannot hesitate to fix or replace it, the &lsquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke don&rsquo;t fix it&rsquo; approach is terrible i relation to drugs because people are dying every day that can be saved when there is a better policy available but not in use. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c6 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1">Bad people should be punished, in the modern age punishment is prison, that has been a constant belief of almost every civilization from the dawn of society, but what has been inconsistent is who is bad. Regardless of morality and right and wrong, addicts or even recreational drug users are no worse than a person who watches TV all day every day. Both aren&rsquo;t harming others (at least when treatment or clinics are available, drugs and crime are only related when it is illegal to obtain or have drugs) and both are equally as unproductive in the society. Both children and adults alike are to be taught on which drugs are harmful, the severity of their use, and their effects, they are to be discouraged in most recreational use, but with the effects being told without bias. The greatest problem with drug laws and policies in the U.S. as well as across the world is that they are based on politics and the law maker&rsquo;s misunderstanding of the benefits, uses, and consequences of each drug.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6 c1"></span></p>
