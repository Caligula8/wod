<p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thousand of years, the indigenous people of the world have crowned and used sacred plants as medicine. These sacred plants, often psychoactive, have been said to give those who used them access to the spirit world for guidance and divine healing. The most common of these plants included psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca brew, as well as the peyote plant. There are even legitimate theories speculating the rapid development of the human mind being a result of psilocybin being introduced into the &nbsp;human diet. Fast forwarding to modern day, these plants are still relevant in their healing ability, but now backed by research and scientific study. With the creations and discoveries of new psychoactive compounds in the recent past, such as LSD and DMT, the U.S. government has decided, to place, and refuse to lift, a ban on any and all psychoactive compounds based on lies spread by the presidents of the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s for political gain.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a study from 2011, researchers at UCLA conducted observons on 12 terminal cancer patients who were diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. In this study, each subject was given either a placebo or a small controlled dose of psilocybin, the active component in what is commonly referred to today as &lsquo;magic mushrooms&rsquo;. After the session, all of those who have taken the hallucinogen showed clear signs of much lower levels of anxiety, describing having an increased sense of acceptance and peace with their lives and situation. Decreased signs of depression were also shown in all but one of the subjects. Psilocybin did not only alter the chemistry of depressed and anxious brains, in many cases, it had been described as changing the patients themselves. The subjects of these studies experienced hallucinogenic episodes lasting between 20 minutes ranging all the way to several hours. During these experiences, many subjects described gaining the ability to think and feel about the difficulties they faced more clearly than previous to the study; reporting thoughts on what they&rsquo;d miss after they died or how their families and loved ones would cope be changed with their deaths. The sessions were all incredibly intense due to the patient&rsquo;s mental states, but most reported no longer having the dreadful thoughts that had accompanied their minds before, and the lack of these thoughts remained manageable for long after the treatments, lasting as little as 6 months for most. (Grob 2011)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In another study (Johnson 2014), in a 15 week period of sessions, 15 participants, who were also heavy smokers, underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, with psilocybin being introduced once at week 5 and once at week 7. On average, each person would smoke 19 cigarettes a day for the past 31 years. Keeping in mind that &ldquo;even the best current psychological or pharmacological treatments for tobacco addiction, which are typically around 35%,&rdquo;(Johnson, 2009), all patients reported no longer feeling the need to smoke after the 15 week period. In a six month follow up, 12 out of the 15 participants had completely quit smoking, which is 80% of the group. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 16 million americans are living with diseases caused by smoking. Cigarettes today kill over 480,000 people in the U.S. annually, 15% of adults smoke today in the United States, in the second half of the twentieth century, that number could reach as high as 60% (HHS 2014). It&rsquo;s truly is difficult to imagine how many people could still be alive today if they had had this therapy available.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;In a way, the government is partially responsible for many of the deaths that have been caused as a result of illegalizing, and keeping these substances illegal. Not only for the deaths from tobacco, but also any alcohol related deaths. However, and luckily, a huge effort has been made towards that of demonizing tobacco in the United States through advertisement campaigns and stricter regulations on marketing. Sadly the same cannot be said about alcohol or caffeine for that matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With a test group of 400,000 participants, spanning across dozens of studies from the 1950&rsquo;s to the early 1970&rsquo;s, the effects of LSD or lysergic acid diethylamide had been studied extensively. However, all studies had come to a stop with the illegalization of LSD and most other psychoactive drugs, many of which went uncompleted with inconclusive data. Analysing 6 trials from the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s, involving a total of 536 patients, a 2012 study came to the conclusion that alcohol was a successful tool for overcoming alcohol addiction as well as and was &ldquo;as successful as any treatment since[...] We&rsquo;re talking about one or two doses producing life-long effects&rdquo;(Nutt,2012). In the findings, krebs goes on to say &ldquo;A single dose of LSD, in the context of various alcoholism treatment programs, is associated with a decrease in alcohol misuse.&rdquo; (Krebs 2012).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What makes experiments so difficult, is their illegality. Psilocybin for example, is illegal just about everywhere in the world due to the United States&rsquo;s influence throughout the years, including the naturally occurring mushrooms from which the molecule is extracted and even the spores on the mushroom. In rare cases however, scientists are able to get special and limited licenses that are full of restrictions. Sadly, in most cases research has ceased due to illegality and high regulation. According the the FDA, schedule 1 substances, the most dangerous class of chemicals, are defined as having a high potential for abuse with no accepted medical use. It is, at this point, undoubtable and inadmissible that the government is wrong in banning psychedelic substances, It is unacceptable for the amount of people that have died and crimes that have been committed not only as a result of the black market values and organized crime (Figure 3),but also as those who could not get medical treatment when they needed it, never knowing it was even an option. The government and the war on drugs, making drug users looked down upon by society and even thrown into prison, is at full blame for all of the deaths it has caused.</span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p>
