<p class="c0"><span class="c7">Barry McCaffrey, head of the National Drug Control Policy Office during the Bill Clinton presidency stated &quot;What we&#39;re convinced doesn&#39;t work is to just arrest people, lock them up and throw them back on the street the way you got them.&quot; McCaffrey estimated that the country could save over 5 billion dollars annually if treatment were substituted for incarceration for the quarter million Americans that were in prison at that time. (Cole 2001, p252). It costs over $20,000 per year to have a person incarcerated, and yet, studies consistently conclude that the most effective response to drug use is treatment and prevention. The Rand Corporation found that treatment is seven times more cost-effective than incarceration in reducing drug consumption. (Caulkins 1997). According to the U.S. Dept. of Justice, &ldquo;Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. prison population has grown an average of 45,000 inmates per year.&rdquo; (BJS 2002). </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">A three year study found that in 2005, at least $467.7 billion were spent on fighting drugs. The study found that for every dollar that was spent towards the War on Drugs, 95.6 cents went towards substance use and addiction. Which they defined as spending to carry the burden of government programs including health, child/family/housing assistance, public safety, justice, elementary/secondary education, mental health, developmental disabilities and workforce. A pitiful 1.9 cents went towards prevention and treatment, 0.4 cents on research, 0.7 cents to interdiction, and 1.4 cents on regulation and taxation. Of the conservative estimate of $238 billion spent in 2005 on substance abuse and addiction, 58% or $207 billion was spent on health care, which was followed by 13% or $47 billion spent on the justice system, which includes incarceration, &nbsp;parole, probation,and criminal, juvenile, and family courts (CASA 2009).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Of the $3.3 Trillion in total government spending of 2005, 11% was spent repairing the consequences of alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse and addiction. If substance abuse were an individual federal budget category, it would rank 6th, only to &nbsp;be surpassed by social security, national defense, income security, and health programs such as Medicaid. State governments spent nearly 16% of their budgets on substance abuse and addiction. If substance abuse and addiction were it&rsquo;s own individual budget category on the state level, it would rank second, only to be surpassed by the spending on secondary and elementary school education. State governments spend more on substance abuse and addiction than they do on welfare and transportation. The report recommends the most cost effective methods to reduce human suffering and reverse the spending patterns the expansion of research, treatment and disease management, altering tax and regulatory policies, prevention and early intervention, and most importantly addiction centers (CASA 2009).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Using the estimated $20,000 per person (with some estimates going as high as $40,000), and ignoring the increasing rate of prisoners incarcerated due to drug crimes, and using the given 33% of the prison population (both federal and state) having drug offenses as their most major conviction (Raphael, Stoll 2008), the estimated amount of money that the government spent on housing drug convicted criminals in 2013 would be as low as $16.5 billion and high as $33 billion. Taking the Rand Corporation&#39;s estimate on how much money treatment instead of prison could have saved (seven times less money to treat), the total amount of money the government could have saved would have been over 28 billion dollars. That is 10 billion dollars greater than NASA&rsquo;s annual budget, if that amount of money had been saved, and redirected towards the NASA budget for as little as a three to four years, the United States could have sent a man to mars within that period of time, and had the technology start a colony there. The most expensive Apollo mission, Apollo 17, cost about $2.42 billion for reference. (adjusted for 2011 inflation, $445 million originally)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p>
