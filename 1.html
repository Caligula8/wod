<p class="c4"><span class="c2 c6">&ldquo;The true student of science neglects nothing and despises nothing that may widen and deepen his knowledge of nature, and if he is wise as well as learned he will hesitate before he applies the term &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; to any facts which are widely believed and have been repeatedly observed by men as intelligent and honest as himself.&rdquo;</span><span class="c2"><br>Alfred Wallace,</span><span class="c2 c6 c14">&nbsp;Are the Phenomena of Spiritualism in Harmony with Science?</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c2 c11"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s easy to point out the dangers of drugs, easy to blind oneself to their nature. Easy to mindlessly hide behind the challenges they bring. But what is not easy, is to take a serious look at what we call our society as Americans and address the issues that have plagued the country since the Nixon presidency. Since Nixon, this battle has been labeled &quot;The War on Drugs&quot;. This battle is extremely expensive; equating to 19.2 billion dollars a year, and an accumulated cost of over 1 trillion dollars of taxpayer money. The war on drugs was a failure of the country because of how little good has come as an outcome; as a result, unimaginable amounts advancements in both medicine and technology have yet to be discovered, as well as hundreds of billions, if not, over a trillion dollars that have been spent on drug crime management and keeping drug offenders in prison</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The failure to end the War on Drugs has gone against gone against the core principles the Unites States were built on, what drugs are acceptable have become a matter of political engineering, dogmatic and unchallengeable views and policies held up by some of the highest positions of power throughout the government, none of which having a clear scientific basis as to why, many of which not even having a clear reason. This is partially due to the abundance of people with distorted views on what a drug is; to understand a substance&rsquo;s effects first one must have a clear idea of what the substance is, and the majority of people don&rsquo;t know either. Some people believe that plants, cannabis for example, aren&rsquo;t drugs because they grow naturally, others, are either completely oblivious to or deny the possibility of substances they use daily being drugs, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine being the main examples. This is absurd, wildly illogical by the definition of it. The following definition of a drug is objective, accepted in the scientific community, and is to be applied throughout the entirety of this essay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c12">Drug: </span><span class="c2 c6">Any substance which has a physiological or psychological effect when ingested or otherwise present in the body.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
