<p style="line-height:2.0;">This did not make it into the essay due to the topics being too controvercil for me to comfortably add to an acedemic paper, and ddue to irrelevence from the argument. I was going to refer the reader to my autobiography anyway so I may as well place the story behind the essay with it</p>
<p style="line-height:2.0;">This essay was made in interest of harm reduction, awareness, and political protest. There are far too many individuals operating day to day under false assumptions and radical beliefs based on no scientific evidence or even just plain brainwashing from birth by the definition of it. I’m not going to sugar coat it, people are dying because the U.S. government has no clue what they’re doing. Not only are the broken policies and laws responsible both directly and indirectly for more deaths than any other man caused event, organization, or government in the world, but the U.S. government has managed to spend over a trillion dollars while legitimizing the war in every way possible, and I have a problem with that. 
<p style="line-height:2.0;">Terence Mckenna was an American ethnobotanist, lecturer, writer, philosopher, and psychonaut who’s life goal was to promote the responsible use of naturally occurring plant based hallucinogens. In his interviews, lectures, and books, the topics he discussed ranged across  psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, philosophy, culture, technology, environmentalism, and the theoretical origins of human consciousness. Many of his beliefs may seem crazy at first such as his Timewave-Zero theory or the claim to the existence of machine elves, but his conceptual imagination in language so potent and eloquent that within the first hour of listening to him speak, he almost always completely shifts or transcends the listeners reality from what it previously was, regardless of the lecture. He has the most extraordinary aptitude to describe nature and subjective experiences under the influence of hallucinogens in the most extraordinarily lucid detail.</p>
<p style="line-height:2.0;">Note that my love for the ideas and work of Terence Mckenna does not mean that I condone the use of any illegal substance in areas in which they are illegal, I very much enjoy the perks of being a law abiding citizen and do not plan to even go near any psychedelic substance until much later in my life (30-40 years old). At that point my options would be (assuming the laws regarding drug legality stay the same in which case they won’t) either therapeutic Ayahuasca session(s) under the influence of a Shaman or Psilocybin truffles in the Netherlands which are completely legal.
<p  style="line-height:2.0;">Terence mckenna is however the reason I wrote this essay; the issues he raised against society and culture were very legitimate and ever since, even before I thought about writing this essay, I have been researching every possible resource I could find to better educate myself on the subject.
<p  style="line-height:2.0;">This essay started off as a history research paper, I decided to pick my topic to be The War on Drugs due to my recent and growing interest in Terence Mckenna at the time This was before I switched topics from Taoism  for my personal annual essay so I didn’t think that the 5 page limit would be a problem since I didn’t plan for this to be my long essay for the year. The next thing I knew it was 3am the night before the research paper was due and I had 13 pages done with no intent of stopping anytime soon Right before I submitted I just took out the least important parts of what was there and thought, I didn’t even care about my research paper grade anymore, this essay was far too important and interesting for me to stop there, and looking back I don’t regret it.
<p  style="line-height:2.0;">The greatest struggle with this paper was definitely my sleeping habits, there was a period of 5 months where almost no progress was made because of how bad my sleeping schedule got and how unmotivated I was, I wasn’t doing homework, I wasn’t studying for school, I didn’t get a single productive thing done in that whole period of time. Even now it's slightly better but I’m still recovering. The fact that I had this obstacle does make it a much greater personal accomplishment that I finished and got the essay to 40 pages than if I didn’t have any sleeping problems.</p>
