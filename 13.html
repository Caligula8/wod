<p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Most psychedelics, especially the traditional ones, have zero to no potential for addiction. In fact, with constant use, the desire to consume psychedelics will actually decrease. Furthermore, you build an immediate tolerance to all tryptamines and phenethylamines. This tolerance, from a single heavy experience can take as little as one month to return to complete normal, with many people claiming their tolerances to be reset after about 2 weeks. If one were to consume any psychedelic once a week for a considerable amount of time (once a week is considered to be an extremely heavy usage rate), the experiences would become much less intense than they once were, this is due to the building of a natural tolerance to the substance. This means that if one were to consume a psychedelic on a daily basis, much like a person addicted to crack-cocaine or methamphetamines, there would be little to no return for their efforts, just throwing money at these drugs which have less and less of an effect with every experience. According to the FDA &ldquo;Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse and the potential to create severe psychological and/or physical dependence.&rdquo; Placing and keeping psychedelic substances under schedule 1 for over 50 years is just to show how little justification the government needs for its actions.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">DMT or Dimethyltryptamine experiences, or Ayahuasca (a method to make DMT orally active as well as last longer ) experiences have been known to be so powerful and influential on a person, that it is not unheard of for drug users who try it to only do it once in their lives. Terence Mckenna once asked a friend in the early 2000&rsquo;s &lsquo;what his favorite drug was&rsquo;, his friend replied &lsquo;DMT&rsquo;, Mckenna then asked &lsquo;when was the last time you did it&rsquo;, his friend replied 1984; to his friend that experience was so significant and life changing that he was still processing and implementing the effects into his life. This is the case for many, DMT when vaporized is known to only last 15 minutes, with some humorously calling it the &ldquo;Businessman&#39;s trip&rdquo; as a result, but yet in that time 4 out of 5 adults will rate it the single most spiritual experience of their lives. This drug, which is also schedule 1 meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical value, has been known by its users who only take it once in their lives, (once a year is considered heavy usage,) will often times describe themselves as more rational, less stressed (especially with death), and having much more productive lives, giving their lives true meaning for the first time ever shortly after (Velder &nbsp;2013, Bouso &amp; Riba 2013).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
